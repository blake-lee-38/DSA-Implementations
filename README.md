# Implementation of Data Structures

Welcome!
This repository contains implementations of many essential Data Structures as part of my Data Structures & Algorithms (CS2413) course. There are 8 folders, each containing source files for a different DS as indicated by the folder names. All of these were written in C++ and use concepts like dynamic memory allocation and deletion to ensure efficient use.

# Takeaways

These assignments were essential in helping me develop a solid knowledge base for different Data Structures, including the uses and advantages of each.
